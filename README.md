We are 3 students - Sudhanva, Sriganesh and Pavan. At the time of writing this, we are in the third year of Computer Science Engineering, and this is our first time coding trading algorithms. This project is an effort to learn implement trading algorithms. Our goal is to explore how trading strategies work, analyze market behavior, build algorithms for backtesting and finally to deploy after adequate learning in a paper trading environment. The repository is organized into folders for different algorithms.
